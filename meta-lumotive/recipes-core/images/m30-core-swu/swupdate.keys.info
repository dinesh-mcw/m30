To sign code, the following are required:
swupdate.priv.pem -- Must be copied here from external source for a swupdate image to be built
swupdate.priv.pem.pass -- Lives here (in Git), used to decrypt the above

The two files should never be stored together. Both are required to successfully sign code. 
Storing them separately requires that two stores be compromised in order to code sign.
