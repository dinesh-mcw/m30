    comment: "When written, BIST operation starts. In 'single' rail
              mode, `byte_idx` is the byte excited within the voltage
              pattern table, corresponding to the target LCM rail. In
              'full' rail mode, BIST excites bytes from byte_sel = 0
              to byte_sel = `byte_idx`, inclusive. In 'adc' mode, the
              controller collects ADC samples and saves them into the
              FIFO and word 0 of the BIST RAM (lo data point)--there
              is no manipulation of the LCM."

    comment: "Allows a custom pattern to be used for Bist foreground
              measurements. Set `tm_bypass_flash` = 1 and
              `tm_buff_src_idx` = 0/1 to choose the source buffer for the
              pattern. Set Bist's `reset_code` to control the bias for
              background measurements. Set byte_idx = 0 (or even number)
              to sample when POL = 1 (e.g. for odd driver pins) and set
              byte_idx = 1 (or odd number) to sample when POL = 0 (e.g.
              for even driver pins). All other fields should function as
              usual. Start Bist in 'single' rail mode.

              Note: This feature should only be used for 'single' rail
              mode since the Bist controller doesn't reset the background
              pattern after each rail iteration. That is, it assumes the
              last foreground pattern was one-hot and then writes once
              to get back to all rails being at the reset code. This
              scheme doesn't work when the last foreground pattern is
              arbitrary."
