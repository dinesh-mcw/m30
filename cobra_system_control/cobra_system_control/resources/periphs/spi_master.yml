    comment: "When written, this field causes a SPI transaction to be
              sent to the DAC device using the provided
              parameters. The spi_clk_div parameter controls the bus
              clock frequency as follows:
                  freq = min(50, 100 / (spi_clk_div + 1)) [MHz].

    comment: "When deasserted, the value of spi_clk_div in the control word is
              a terminal count such that the SPI bus has clock frequency

                freq [MHz] = 100 / (CLK_DIV + 1) if CLK_DIV > 0 else 50 MHz

              When asserted, the value of spi_clk_div in the control word is
              proportional to frequency such that the SPI bus has clock
              frequency

                freq [MHz] = 100 / round(100 / (CLK_DIV + 1)) ~= CLK_DIV + 1"
