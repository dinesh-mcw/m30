    comment: "Delay from the LP-00 State to the assertion of the d_hs_rdy_o signal
              The actual HS-ZERO on the D-PHY data lanes still depends on these
              three factors:
                  1. The delay between the d_hs_rdy_o assertion and the time
                  the requestor sends the payload of a long packet
                  2. The number of cycles the packet header (if enabled) can
                  create the sync pattern and the 32-bit header.
                  This varies with the number of lanes and gearing.
                  3. The serializer delay. The timing from parallel data
                  input to the serialized output data differs between soft and
                  hard D-PHY implementation."
