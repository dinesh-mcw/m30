Make sure TCP send buffer is large enough (frontend will exit if not). E.g.:
sudo sysctl -w net.core.wmem_max=181632000

Useful for keeping an eye on socket state (if we start to abuse the TCP stack...):

watch -n 1 "ss -o -e -i -m state all '( dport = 12566 or sport = 12566 )'"
ss -o -e -i -m state all '( dport = 12566 or sport = 12566 )'
